# Frequency-Counter
Algorithms Home Work: Write a function called "same", which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. 

To Run: 

paste this code in a NotePad file and save it as .js. open another empty note pad in the same directory and paste this:
<!Doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src = "the .js file goes here"></script>
  </body>
</html>

next, save this file as .html. After that open this file with your favorite browser and when inside the browser, press f12. The console should show up.

Testing: Open the .js file, on top of the file you will see 2 arrays (or lists of numbers), alter these numbers and follow the instructions above to run the algorithm. Dont forget to save.
